# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction Project
Analyzing churning rate is important for telecom companies because losing a customer is expensive. 
This project focuses on analyzing telecom data and predict churn rate using Python. I built several supervised machine learning models to get high accuracy prediction, and found top 3 important features that are associated with churn rate. Please refer to jupyter notebook to see the full project.
